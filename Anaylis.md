Search/Sort used in this experimental test program were: 

Linear Search 

	Searches item by item from start to finish through the desired object until it finds it.  

	It has the highest possible number of computations therefor it has the highest time to search through a large set of data.  

		It ran through 2000 values in about 90 seconds on average. 

		2000 pointers in about 10 seconds 

		
		In a set of 2000 values, it could take from one to 2000 decisions before it decies if a value is in the set.
		
Binary Search 

	Divides the search in half over and over again until it finds the desired object.  

	It has a much lower number of maximum computations it will take to find a value in a large set.  

	It ran through 2000 values/ pointers in a fraction of a second  

	In a set of 100 values if it does not find the anwer first, it would have eliminated half of the choices. 


Bubble/Exchange sort 

	Bubble sort compares values that are juxtaposed and changes the position of the higher value.  

	It is referred to bubble sort because the highest ( or lowest) value rise like a bubble to the end of the data set.  

	It sorted the values in about 2 tenths of a second 

Merge Sort 

	Merge sort breaks up the values in a set into a tree like structure 

	It reassembles them in order by performing comparisons  

	It sorted the 2000 values in about a Pico second.  

	Lowest number of computations for a large set.
